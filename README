Sandblox

What is it?
-----------

Sandblox is an extreme sandboxing game "framework" (I use the term loosely here, as it strongly suggests a specific super-genre of gaming and has hardwired game element support) designed to have as much flexible freedom as possible while maintaing general compatibility with other mods. The framework itself has no actual content; the mods the user plugs in define the experience.

The ultimate goal (if it hasn't been achieved by the time this is read) is to have a network of connected game systems, or "universes," players can go to which may have different rules, blocks, recipes, creatures, species, maps, etc., all delivered via packaged cross-compatible Python modules, settings, and resources. When one world becomes dull, the player can create a new one with different rules or download maps to play.

Planned Features
----------------

 * Complete safety from intentionally malicious mods via sandboxing
 * Plug-and-play module installation
 * World-oriented modules rather than distribution-oriented modules
 * A module API designed to make incompatibility difficult
 * A simple GUI interface to break apart and recombine mods
   - Automated author credit management
 * Automated mod distribution when connecting to servers without a required mod
 * C/++ accelerated engine to do the heavy work
 * Use of Python for flexibility and ease of writing modules
 * Event-driven API for even more flexibility and some speed benefits
 * Clients can optionally act concurrently as servers
   - Use of UPnP to make setting up a server as easy as clicking a checkbox widgit
   - Detailed port-forwarding instructions for users with no UPnP support
